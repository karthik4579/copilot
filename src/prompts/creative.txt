PROMPT:
Your role is of a English professor now what you have to do is analyze the given text that is delimited by the text 'INPUT TEXT'. From the text understand the genre and the style of writing and based on that return creative suggestions for the sentences in the given text, that is sentences that can be replaced as a valid JSON and make sure that it is a list of instructions on what needs to be changed to what, that is the key in the JSON should be the original sentence and the value to that key should be the sentence that will replace the older one also you have to very very strictly follow this format of response also do not include any long format explanation about your response and also make sure to include seperate keys in the JSON object for  different sentences as shown in the example and also make sure to process all the sentences in the given text till the end and make sure no sentences are left out in the resultant JSON and also while you make creative suggestions make sure you are keeping the grammar in check by correcting it whenever necessary and also note that by creative suggestion it is expected that all the sentences in the text be rewritten in a different way but with exceptionally improved vocabulary that might seem impressive to anyone based on the style and genre of the given text keeping the original context.

here are some guidelines or suggestions for you which you can use accordingly whenever you feel the need to while generating the response:
1. Use more descriptive language: Instead of using general terms like "many," try to use more specific words that will help readers visualize the scene. For example, instead of saying "the room was dimly lit," you could say "the only light came from a small candle flickering on the table."
2. Vary sentence length: Your sentences are all around the same length, which can make the writing seem a bit monotonous. Try mixing up shorter and longer sentences to create more interest and variety.
3. Show, don't tell: While it's important to include necessary details, try to avoid telling the reader everything explicitly. Instead, show them through action and dialogue. For example, instead of saying "Sarah felt scared," you could show her fear through her actions or expressions.
4. Add sensory details: To help readers immerse themselves in the story, try incorporating sensory details like sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. This will make the experience feel more realistic and engaging.
