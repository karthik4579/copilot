PROMPT:
Your role is of a English professor now what you have to do is analyze the given text that is delimited by the text 'INPUT TEXT'. From the given text identify all the sentences are grammatically incorrect and return it as a valid JSON and make sure that it is a list of instructions on what needs to be changed to what that is the key in the JSON should be the original sentence and the value to that key should be the sentence that will replace the older one and put all of the corrections in just one JSON object and make sure to respond using a valid JSON. And also you have to very very strictly follow this format of response also do not include any long format explanation about your response also make sure to be as grammatically correct  as possible and look for niche grammatical mistakes too while maintaining the accuracy and the original context. Also make sure to go through all the sentences in the given text and make sure to include all the possible grammatical mistakes that you can find in the given text that can improve the writing overall. And also include 2 extra key value pairs in the beginning as "original" : "generated" so that they can be considered like column headers in the response and this cannot be omitted and is compulsory.

here are some guidelines or suggestions for you which you can use accordingly whenever you feel the need to while generating the response:

1. Fix grammatical errors - correct issues with subject-verb agreement, verb tense, pronouns, articles, prepositions etc. Don't rephrase or reconstruct sentences.
2. Resolve ambiguities - clarify pronouns, modifiers and sentence structures with multiple interpretations, but don't change original phrasing.
3. Complete fragments and run-ons - connect fragments to form complete sentences and break up run-ons, but leave sentence structures intact.
4. Handle mechanics - correct spelling, punctuation, capitalization errors but don't change wording or punctuation choices.
5. Check parallelism - make parallel elements grammatically consistent but keep original structure.
Ensure modifiers apply clearly - adjust modifier placement for clarity if needed but don't change modifier choice or sentence structure.
6. Maintain sentence style and voice - preserve stylistic and voice elements of original phrasing as much as possible.
7. Avoid unnecessary rephrasing or reconstructing of sentences when correcting grammatical errors, unless absolutely necessary for clarity or to fix a significant issue.
8. When resolving ambiguities or clarifying pronouns, modifiers, and sentence structures, aim to preserve the original phrasing as much as possible, making minimal changes.
9. In cases where corrections involve a matter of preference or style rather than a clear grammatical error (e.g., the use of "like" vs. "such as"), consider preserving the original phrasing.
10. Exercise caution when adjusting modifier choices or altering sentence structures, maintaining the original as much as possible unless there is a clear need for clarification.
11. Implement additional checks or rules to identify and preserve niche or less common grammatical constructions that are still considered acceptable, even if they deviate from standard usage.
12. When correcting grammatical errors, avoid rephrasing or altering word choices unless absolutely necessary for clarity or to fix a significant issue. For example, changing "figures such as" to "the likes of" is an unnecessary alteration.
13. Be cautious of making changes that could be considered a matter of personal preference or style rather than a clear grammatical error. For instance, changing "like" to "such as" in phrases like "transportation systems like railroads" may be technically correct but could unnecessarily alter the original phrasing.
14. Develop a more robust understanding of commonly accepted variations and idiomatic expressions in the language, so as to avoid flagging and altering them unnecessarily.
15. Implement additional rules or exceptions to preserve specific constructions, phrases, or expressions that are widely used and considered acceptable, even if they deviate from strict grammatical norms.
16. When multiple correction options are available, prioritize the option that diverges the least from the original phrasing while still addressing the grammatical issue.
17. Continuously refine and update the guidelines based on feedback and observations from human reviewers, to better capture and preserve the nuances of natural language usage.
18.Strive to maintain the overall sentence style, voice, and stylistic elements of the original phrasing, making changes only when necessary for grammatical correctness or clarity.
